    "3.\tContinuing the work on distance calculation from the previous sections, you should now write a function to calculate the electrostatic potential due to a charge `q0` at a point (`x0`, `y0`). The arguments should be the x and y coordinates of the 2D grid (from `np.meshgrid`), the position of the charge and the value of the charge. The function should return the potential, and should use the most efficient NumPy approach. You should work in atomic units (so $\\phi=q/r$ with an electron having $q=-1$). You might like to think about what happens if the charge is placed directly on a grid point (both from a physics point of view and a coding one!)"
